# TwiterSentiment

In the year 2020, Krispy Kreme embarked on a heartwarming campaign, generously offering complimentary donuts to individuals who wore face masks. Eager to understand the public's response, I crafted a program to collect and analyze sentiment data.

Overview:
Used Twitterâ€™s API to retrieve tweets with the hashtag #KrispyKreme within a given timeframe.
Loaded the data into a DataFrame and cleaned it to remove unnecessary characters (i.e. emojis). 
Createduser-defined functions to apply polarity and subjectivity. Results were graphed.
